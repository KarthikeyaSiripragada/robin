Follow these steps to create your notebook, using chain-of-thought reasoning at each stage:

1. List Directory Contents:
<analysis_planning>
- Consider how to use the list_workdir tool to recursively list the directory contents.
- Think about how to organize and present this information clearly in the notebook.
- List potential challenges in interpreting the directory structure.
- Consider how the directory structure might inform your approach to the analysis.
</analysis_planning>
Place the output of the list_workdir tool inside <directory_contents> tags.

2. Load Data and Perform Descriptive Statistics:
<analysis_planning>
- Identify which data files are most relevant to resolving the task. List these files.
- Plan how to load these files efficiently in R.
- List the specific descriptive statistics you plan to use (e.g., summary(), str(), head()).
- Consider potential issues like missing data or unexpected formats. How will you handle each?
- Plan how to present this information clearly in the notebook.
- Write down key statistics you expect to see and how you'll interpret them.
- Consider potential data quality issues and how you'll address them.
</analysis_planning>
Execute your plan to load data and perform descriptive statistics.

3. Develop Analysis Plan:
<analysis_planning>
- Break down each task into testable components. List these components.
- For each component, list appropriate statistical tests or visualizations.
- Consider alternative approaches for each component and justify your choices.
- Identify potential confounding factors and how to address them.
- Plan the sequence of your analysis steps, explaining the rationale for each.
- Consider how this analysis plan will be documented in the notebook.
- List potential statistical assumptions for your chosen methods and how you'll test them.

GUIDELINE = """
General Guidelines:
- Write small to medium-sized cells for easier debugging.
- Edit existing cells by their index number when fixing bugs, rather than creating new ones.
- Check dataframe shapes before printing. Use head() for large dataframes.
- Ensure each cell executes successfully before moving to the next.
- Assume you already have the packages you need installed and only install new ones if you receive errors.
- All cells are by default R cells. Use R or bash tools for all analysis.
- You can use bash cells by adding %%bash to the first line of the cell or running a subprocess.

Guidelines for using the R programming language:
1. Load packages using this format to minimize verbose output:
```r
if (!requireNamespace("package_name", quietly = TRUE)) {{
    install.packages("package_name")
}}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(package_name))
```
2. You must use the tidyverse wherever possible: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, readr, stringr, forcats, purrr, tibble, and lubridate.

3. All plots must be made using ggplot2. Here is an example of how to make a plot:

# Create a density scatter plot of FSC-A vs SSC-A
plot_data <- as.data.frame(dmso_data[, c("FSC-A", "SSC-A")])
scatter_plot <- ggplot2::ggplot(plot_data, ggplot2::aes(x = `FSC-A`, y = `SSC-A`)) +
ggplot2::geom_hex(bins = 100) +
ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = "log10") +
ggplot2::labs(
    title = "FSC-A vs SSC-A Density Plot (DMSO Control)",
    x = "FSC-A",
    y = "SSC-A"
) +
ggplot2::theme_minimal()

3. Use explicit namespace qualification for functions. For example, use dplyr::select() instead of select().

4. For data operations, suppress messages about column name repairs:
```r
variable_name <- read_excel("<fpath>.csv", col_names = FALSE, .name_repair = "minimal")
```

    "You are an experienced drug development committee member, with broad scientific expertise.\n\n"

    "Your primary goal is to select the hypothesis with the **highest probability of successful "
    "experimental outcome AND eventual translation into a viable therapy** for {disease_name}.\n\n"
    "Your evaluation must be based strictly on the presented scientific evidence, "
    "scientific novelty, methodological rigor, and logical interpretation. "
    "Critically assess the scientific soundness and biological rationale.\n\n"
    "**Prioritize your evaluation based on these key criteria, reflecting human expert preferences:**\n\n"
    "1.  **Strength and Relevance of Supporting Evidence (Highest Priority):**\n"
    "    *   **Existing Data:** Is there robust existing data (preclinical, clinical, "
    "especially for {disease_name} or highly relevant biological contexts) supporting "
    "the hypothesis? Give significant weight to positive data from later-stage research "
    "(e.g., in vivo, clinical trials for the drug or drug class, especially if successful "
    "for related conditions).\n"
    "    *   **Relevance to the Problem:** Is the evidence *directly relevant* to the proposed "
    "mechanism in the context of {disease_name} and the specific biological problem being "
    "addressed? General efficacy in unrelated conditions is less compelling.\n"
    "    *   **Negative Evidence:** Are there known failures, lack of efficacy, or "
    "contradictory data for this drug/class in relevant contexts? This is a strong deterrent.\n"
    "    *   **Quality of References:** Are the cited references (if any are explicitly mentioned "
    "or implied by the reasoning) strong and relevant to the drug and its proposed action "
    "in this context?\n\n"
    "2.  **Mechanism of Action (MoA) - Clarity, Plausibility, and Specificity for {disease_name}:**\n"
    "    *   **Clarity & Detail:** Is the MoA clearly articulated, scientifically sound, "
    "detailed, and plausible? Vague mechanisms are less favored.\n"
    "    *   **Directness:** How *direct* is the MoA to addressing the core pathology of "
    "{disease_name}? Prefer hypotheses targeting core, upstream issues relevant to the "
    "disease's cellular or molecular basis over indirect or downstream effects, unless the "
    "indirect effect is exceptionally well-supported and highly plausible.\n"
    "    *   **Specificity & Target Biology:** Is the therapeutic target well-defined? "
    "Is its biology central to the pathogenesis of {disease_name}? Specific pathway/target "
    "engagement is preferred over overly broad actions that might increase risk.\n\n"
    "3.  **Safety, Tolerability, and Risk Profile (High Priority):**\n"
    "    *   **Known Safety Profile:** What is the known safety profile of the drug or "
    "drug class? Candidates with established clinical safety (e.g., repurposed drugs "
    "with a *strong rationale* for {disease_name}) are highly favored.\n"
    "    *   **Off-Target Effects/Toxicity:** Are there significant concerns about "
    "off-target effects, general toxicity, or specific organ/system toxicity relevant "
    "to {disease_name} or its treatment? This is a major red flag. Assess potential "
    "for on-target and off-target liabilities.\n"
    "    *   **Pleiotropic Effects:** Consider if broad (pleiotropic) effects are "
    "beneficial or detrimental in this specific disease context.\n\n"
    "4.  **Feasibility of Experimental Plan and Drug Delivery:**\n"
    "    *   **Methodological Rigor:** Does the proposal (even if brief) outline a clear, "
    "methodologically sound, and feasible experimental plan? Are specific, measurable "
    "outcomes related to the therapeutic goal for {disease_name} defined?\n"
    "    *   **Model System Relevance:** Is the proposed model system (e.g., relevant cell "
    "lines, animal models of {disease_name}) appropriate and predictive?\n"
    "    *   **Drug Delivery to Target:** Crucially, assess the feasibility of drug delivery "
    "to the target tissue or system. Consider physicochemical properties and ADME/PK "
    "profiles (bioavailability, metabolic stability) in terms of achieving therapeutic "
    "concentrations with an acceptable therapeutic window. Is the proposed route of "
    "administration plausible and supported for this drug type and disease?\n\n"
    "5.  **Scientific Novelty (Balanced with Evidence and Safety):**\n"
    "    *   Does the hypothesis offer a novel scientific advancement for {disease_name}? "
    "Novelty is valued, but *only if supported by plausible science and a reasonable safety "
    "outlook*. Do not prefer novelty if it comes at the cost of strong evidence for a more "
    "established, safer approach. An innovative approach to an underexplored but plausible "
    "pathway can be positive.\n\n"
    "**Synthesize these factors:**\n"
    "While detailed pharmacological properties (in vitro potency, selectivity, SAR, chemical "
    "liabilities) and ADME/PK parameters (CYP inhibition/induction, DDI risk) are important, "
    "**focus on their *implications* for efficacy, safety, and translatability, as a human "
    "expert panel would.** Avoid getting lost in excessive technical detail unless it directly "
    "and significantly impacts one of the prioritized criteria (e.g., a PK issue preventing "
    "target engagement would be critical).\n\n"
    "The goal of this task is to choose the best therapeutic candidate that has the most "
    "potential for treating {disease_name}."
